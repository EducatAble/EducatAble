## Description
EducatAble is an application that allows opportunities for individuals who are differently abled or fully-abled to understand more about a community that they may not know about. It can be hard to start the conversation and feel comfortable asking certain questions. This app will allow you to understand a perspective different to your normal. EducatAble's goal is to educate those who are willing to learn in a bite-sized approach with a platform for users to register and ask a question about a disability, get random tips, and eventually sign up for a tips-a-day through email.

## How to use
Browse the FAQs and learn things! If you have a question that isn't answered, create and account and you can submit a new question to be answered by someone in the community.
