## Important Things
- [x] Auth stuff: When a user logs out, remove email and admin from local Storage.
- [x] Login/Register: Redirect to home page or FAQ page after a user is logged in, we could then alert that they logged in or something. Maybe a little alert banner?
- [ ] Fav: Delete fav question on the fav page

## Easy
- [ ] Seed db through user/admin functionalities to test as well as seed
- [ ] Create user account for demoing
- [ ] Powerpoint presentation
- [ ] FAQ: clear the question after it is submitted
- [ ] Login: Alert to user when there is a wrong password or email doesnt exist as a registered user. Only console error right now and server console log
- [ ] Register: Password alert shows for an acceptable password, but it will still register the user. So change the message on that case to "sucessful register" or something like that.
- [ ] Register: Display on the page the password requirements so a user knows when signing up what is expected

### Extras
- [ ] Entry password twice to Register
- [ ] Auth stuff: Token saves locally and if user doesn't log out it is still there after the server is restarted and the browser is closed. 
- [ ] FAQ: Consider making the place to submit a question standout a little. (just my opinion xD)
- [ ] Fav: icons load in the saved state, so that when clicked they are removed

- [ ] (Admin) View questions submitted
- [ ] (Admin) Ability to delete/edit existing questions
